## General Cleaning Guidelines

### Regular Cleaning (Every 3-6 Months)
- **Window Frames**: Wipe vinyl frames with a soft cloth dampened with a mild soap and water solution. Avoid abrasive cleaners, solvents, or harsh chemicals that can damage the finish.
- **Tracks & Channels**: Vacuum to remove dust and debris from tracks, then wipe with a damp cloth.
- **Screens**: Remove screens and gently rinse with water and mild soap. Allow to dry completely before reinstalling.

### Deep Cleaning (Annually)
- **Window Tracks**: Clean deeply with a small brush to remove accumulated dirt from corners and hard-to-reach areas.
- **Weep Holes**: Ensure drainage/weep holes at the bottom of window frames remain clear of debris to allow proper water drainage.

### Cleaning Tips
- **Best Weather**: Clean windows on cloudy days to prevent cleaning solution from drying too quickly and leaving streaks.
- **Top-Down Approach**: Start cleaning from the top of the window and work your way down to avoid dripping on already cleaned areas.
- **Microfiber Cloths**: Use lint-free microfiber cloths for streak-free results.

## Window Type-Specific Maintenance

### Double Hung Windows
- **Tilt Mechanism**: Use the tilt-release latches to clean exterior glass surfaces from inside your home.
- **Balance System**: Keep the block and tackle balances clean of debris for optimal operation.
- **Lift Handles**: Clean around the full-length extruded lift handles to ensure smooth operation.

### Slider Windows
- **Sliding Tracks**: Keep tracks clean and free of dirt and debris that can impede smooth operation.
- **Rollers**: Clean around roller areas to maintain easy horizontal movement.
- **Interlocks**: Ensure interlocks are clean and free from obstructions.

### Casement Windows
- **Crank Mechanism**: Lubricate operating hardware annually with a silicone-based lubricant.
- **Hinges**: Ensure hinges are clean and free from debris.
- **Weather Stripping**: Check the weather stripping around the perimeter and replace if worn.

### Bay & Bow Windows
- **Support Structure**: Inspect the support structure annually for any signs of stress.
- **Joints & Seams**: Check caulking around joints and reapply if cracked or deteriorated.
- **Multiple Windows**: Clean each window section individually, following the appropriate guidelines for each window type.

### European Systems
- **Specialized Hardware**: European tilt-turn windows have specialized hardware that should be lubricated annually.
- **Multi-Point Locking**: Clean and lubricate multi-point locking systems to ensure proper sealing.

### Picture Windows
- **Frame Seals**: Check the seal between the frame and glass annually.
- **Support**: Larger picture windows should be inspected for any signs of glass displacement within the frame.

## Hardware Maintenance

### Lubrication (Annually)
- **Moving Parts**: Apply a small amount of silicone-based lubricant to moving parts including:
  - Lock mechanisms
  - Hinges
  - Rollers
  - Operators (cranks)
  - Tilt latches
- **Avoid**: Do not use oil-based lubricants as they attract dust and dirt.

### Inspection
- **Screws & Fasteners**: Check and tighten any loose screws in handles, locks, and hinges.
- **Lock Alignment**: Ensure locks and keepers align properly when windows are closed.

---

## Weather Seal Maintenance

### Inspection
- **Compression Seals**: Check for proper compression when windows are closed.
- **Weatherstripping**: Inspect for tears, gaps, or hardening.
- **Replacement Signs**: Replace weather seals if you notice drafts, moisture infiltration, or increased outside noise.

### Care
- **Cleaning**: Gently clean weather seals with mild soap and water.
- **Conditioning**: Apply a silicone-based protectant to prevent drying and cracking (never use petroleum-based products).

## Glass Care

### Standard Glass
- **Cleaning Solution**: Use a commercially available glass cleaner or make your own with:
  - 1 part white vinegar
  - 10 parts water
  - A few drops of mild dish soap
- **Technique**: Spray solution onto a microfiber cloth (not directly on glass) and wipe in circular motions, then straight lines.

### Special Glass Treatments

#### Low-E Glass
- **Gentle Cleaning**: Use a mild, non-abrasive, non-ammonia-based glass cleaner.
- **Avoid**: Do not use razor blades or abrasive materials that could damage the Low-E coating.

#### Tempered Glass
- **Standard Care**: While stronger than regular glass, clean as you would standard glass.
- **Inspect**: Check occasionally for any signs of stress or damage.

#### Frosted Glass
- **Gentle Products**: Use non-abrasive cleaners designed for specialty glass.
- **Soft Touch**: Clean with soft microfiber cloths to avoid scratching the frosted surface.

#### Argon-Filled Units
- **Seal Inspection**: Regularly check for any fog between panes, which may indicate seal failure and argon leakage.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Difficult Operation
- **Sliders**: Clean tracks and check for obstructions.
- **Double Hung**: Ensure balance systems are clean and functioning.
- **Casement**: Lubricate operator mechanisms and hinges.

### Drafts & Air Leaks
- **Locate**: Use a candle or incense stick to detect air movement (with HVAC system off).
- **Inspect**: Check weatherstripping and replace if damaged.
- **Caulk**: Apply exterior caulking where the window frame meets the house siding.

### Condensation
- **Between Panes**: Indicates seal failure; contact Minmar Windows for assessment.
- **Interior Surface**: Often indicates excessive indoor humidity; improve ventilation or use a dehumidifier.

### Water Leakage
- **Check**: Ensure weep holes are clear of debris.
- **Inspect**: Look for gaps in exterior caulking.
- **Verify**: Make sure the window is completely closed and locked.
