## Understanding Energy Efficiency Ratings

### Primary Energy Performance Measurements

#### U-Factor
- **What It Measures**: Rate of heat transfer through the window (heat loss)
- **Scale**: 0.20–1.20
- **Ideal Value**: Lower is better (less heat escapes)
- **Tri-State Target**: 0.30 or lower for optimal performance in Northeast climate
- **Impact**: A low U-factor is critical for heating-dominated regions like NY, NJ, and CT

#### Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)
- **What It Measures**: Amount of solar radiation admitted through a window
- **Scale**: 0–1
- **Ideal Value**: Lower values reduce solar heat gain
- **Tri-State Target**: 0.30–0.40 provides balance between winter heat gain and summer cooling needs
- **Impact**: In the Northeast, a moderate SHGC allows beneficial solar heat in winter while not overheating in summer

#### Visible Transmittance (VT)
- **What It Measures**: Amount of visible light transmitted through a window
- **Scale**: 0–1
- **Ideal Value**: Higher values provide more natural daylight
- **Tri-State Target**: 0.50 or higher to maximize daylight in often cloudy Northeast conditions
- **Impact**: Higher VT reduces the need for artificial lighting, saving on electricity costs

#### Air Leakage (AL)
- **What It Measures**: Rate of air movement around a window
- **Scale**: 0.1–0.3
- **Ideal Value**: Lower is better
- **Tri-State Target**: 0.1 or lower to combat cold winter air infiltration
- **Impact**: Critical for keeping heating costs down during lengthy Northeast winters

#### Condensation Resistance (CR)
- **What It Measures**: Ability to resist water formation on interior surfaces
- **Scale**: 1–100
- **Ideal Value**: Higher is better
- **Tri-State Target**: 50 or higher for high-humidity Northeast environments
- **Impact**: Prevents moisture damage and potential mold issues in humid summer months

### ENERGY STAR® Certification

#### 2025 Updated ENERGY STAR Requirements for Northern Climate Zone (Including NY, NJ, CT)
- **U-Factor**: ≤ 0.27
- **SHGC**: Any (No minimum requirement)
- **These requirements represent a 15% improvement over the 2023 criteria**

#### ENERGY STAR Most Efficient 2025 Designation
- **U-Factor**: ≤ 0.20
- **SHGC**: ≥ 0.20
- **Air Leakage**: ≤ 0.1

## ROI Calculator Guide

### Understanding Your Investment

#### Factors Affecting ROI
1. **Current Window Efficiency**: Older windows typically provide greater savings when replaced
2. **Energy Costs**: Higher local energy rates increase potential savings
3. **Installation Quality**: Professional installation ensures maximum efficiency benefits
4. **Climate Zone**: More extreme climates offer faster ROI
5. **Tax Incentives**: Federal and state incentives significantly improve ROI

#### Sample ROI Calculation

**Basic Formula**: ROI = (Energy Savings + Increased Home Value + Tax Incentives) ÷ Total Project Cost

**Example for 2,000 sq ft NY Home with 15 Windows**:
- **Project Cost**: $15,000 for ENERGY STAR certified windows
- **Annual Energy Savings**: $350 (based on average NY utility rates)
- **Home Value Increase**: $10,500 (average 70% return on window replacement)
- **Tax Incentives**: $600 (federal) + $375 (state) = $975
- **ROI Calculation**: 
  - First Year ROI: ($350 + $975) ÷ $15,000 = 8.8%
  - Including Home Value: ($350 + $10,500 + $975) ÷ $15,000 = 78.8%
  - Break-even point (excluding home value): Approximately 40 months
